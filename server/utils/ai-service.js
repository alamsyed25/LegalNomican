**Essential Elements:**
- Clear definition of qualifying events (natural disasters, pandemics, government actions)
- Specific notice requirements and timeframes
- Mitigation obligations for both parties

**Recent Legal Developments:**
Courts have become more restrictive in interpreting these clauses. The key test is whether the event actually prevents performance, not just makes it more difficult.
